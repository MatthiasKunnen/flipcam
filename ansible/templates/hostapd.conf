# Interface for separate control program. If this is specified, hostapd
# will create this directory and a UNIX domain socket for listening to requests
# from external programs (CLI/GUI, etc.) for status information and
# configuration. The socket file will be named based on the interface name, so
# multiple hostapd processes/interfaces can be run at the same time if more
# than one interface is used.
# /run/hostapd is the recommended directory for sockets and by default,
# hostapd_cli will use it when trying to connect with hostapd.

# Access control for the control interface can be configured by setting the
# directory to allow only members of a group to use sockets. This way, it is
# possible to run hostapd as root (since it needs to change network
# configuration and open raw sockets) and still allow GUI/CLI components to be
# run as non-root users. However, since the control interface can be used to
# change the network configuration, this access needs to be protected in many
# cases. By default, hostapd is configured to use gid 0 (root). If you
# want to allow non-root users to use the control interface, add a new group
# and change this value to match with that group. Add users that should have
# control interface access to this group.

# SSID protection in 4-way handshake
# The IEEE 802.11i-2004 RSN design did not provide means for protecting the
# SSID in the general case. IEEE P802.11REVme/D6.0 added support for this in
# 4-way handshake. This capability allows a STA to confirm that the AP has the
# same understanding on which SSID is being used for an association in a
# protected manner in cases where both the AP and the STA has this capability.
# This can be used to mitigate CVE-2023-52424 (a.k.a. the SSID Confusion
# Attack).
#
# Ideally, this capability would be enabled by default on the AP, but since this
# is new functionality with limited testing, the default is to disable this for
# now and require explicitly configuration to enable. The default behavior is
# like to change once this capability has received more testing.
