# Troubleshooting

## Polkit authorization prompts are received for managing the systemd services
Make sure the user is part of the flipcam group. You might have to log out and back in again.

## GoPro
Unfortunately, GoPros are not as fault-tolerant and user-friendly as one would expect.

### GoPro unresponsive
If it gets stuck, hold the left button for 15 seconds and release, this forces power off.

### Long beeps every roughly five seconds while trying to stream via QR code
This seems to occur when the passphrase is not correct.
